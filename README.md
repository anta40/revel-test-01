# A very simple restful API using Revel

Original source: https://nilpath.se/building-a-rest-api-in-golang/

### Start the web server:

   revel run revel-test-01

Go to http://localhost:9000/beer and you'll see a list of beers, or http://localhost:9000/beer/2 if you want to see the detail of beer ID 2 (doesn't work, though. Not sure why)
